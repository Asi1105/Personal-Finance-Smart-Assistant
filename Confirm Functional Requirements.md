# **Confirm Functional Requirements**

## **Description**
Review and finalize the system's functional requirements to ensure alignment with project goals and stakeholder expectations.

## **Process & Evidence**
- Reviewed **user needs** and translated them into functional requirements based on the project scope.  
- Aligned requirements with **use case diagram** (e.g., Sign Up/Sign In, Add Transaction, Categorize Transaction, Create/Edit Budget, Track Budget Progress, View Dashboard).  
- Cross-checked requirements against **initial ERD and system architecture** to ensure feasibility.  
- Discussed requirements in team meetings, clarified ambiguities, and obtained consensus.  
- Documented the final set of functional requirements in the shared repository (e.g., Confluence/Google Docs/GitHub Wiki).  

## **Final Functional Requirements**
### **User Management**  
- User can sign up, sign in, and manage their session securely.  

### **Transaction Management**  
- User can add new transactions with details (amount, date, description).  
- User can categorize each transaction (e.g., food, rent, salary).  

### **Budget Management**  
- User can create a budget with a target amount per category.  
- User can edit or delete an existing budget.  

### **Progress Tracking**  
- System tracks budget usage and compares it with actual transactions.  
- User can monitor progress towards budget goals.  

### **Dashboard & Visualization**  
- User can view a dashboard summarizing transactions, budgets, and progress.  

## **Acceptance Criteria**
- All functional requirements are documented and linked to corresponding use cases.  
- Requirements are reviewed and agreed upon by all team members.  
- Requirements are feasible within Sprint 1 timeline and align with Lab instructions (backend in Spring Boot, flexible frontend choice).
